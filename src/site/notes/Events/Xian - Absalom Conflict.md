The [[Groups/Xian Ninja Army\|Xians]] attacked [[Locations/Absalom\|Absalom]] by surprise and the [[Groups/Storm Bringers\|Storm Bringers]] helped repel the initial attack. We then started investigating the attack, at the behest of [[NPCs/Olivia\|Olivia]]. 
It turned out they have been infiltrating [[Locations/Absalom\|Absalom]] for some time. They also killed and kidnaped an elder that had one of three keys to the legendry [[Temple of Tiamat\|Temple of Tiamat]], which they might be trying to reassemble.
 
We were told by [[Dangledick\|Dangledick]] that [[NPCs/Female mafia boss\|Female mafia boss]] was looking for us.

We were captured by the [[bad storm giants tribe\|bad storm giants tribe]] and [[Balu\|Balu]] was killed. We met [[NPCs/Zima\|Zima]], who was studying them. We escaped by wining trial by combat. We first met [[Players/Doliat Dreameyes\|Doliat]], who led us to the [[Locations/Tunnels under the good storm giant tribe\|tunnels]] under the [[Groups/Good storm giants tribe\|Good storm giants tribe]].
We convinced them to help us and they helped lift the siege off [[Locations/Absalom\|Absalom]].
