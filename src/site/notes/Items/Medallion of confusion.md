### Found at
[[Locations/Killgore's cave\|Killgore's cave]], taken from [[NPCs/Kilgore the Warlock\|Killgore]]
### Appearance
Thin metal chain with a many faceted gem, the size of an an acorn, with odd patterns
### Notes
Immediately after being put on the wearer experiences confusion and complete amnesia. While wearing it, it seems no saving throw is possible. Once removed, the condition can be lessened in one of the ways:
- Dispel magic with a DC of 40, which gets lower each day without wearing the medallion
- Each day, the condition naturally lessens. 
After several days, or several dispel magics, the condition is removed.
Might be addictive and cause withdrawal-like symptoms after prolonged use and removal.
