### Found at
Stolen from [[NPCs/Twinkle\|Twinkle]]'s coat at [[a pub near Kyonin\|a pub near Kyonin]]
### Appearance
Normal sealed scrolls
### Notes
- Supposedly non-magical and "emotionally sterile".
- This is very suspicious, as no object is 100% without emotions.
- Most likely done intentionally.
