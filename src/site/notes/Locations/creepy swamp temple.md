### First visited
[[Sessions/001_261223_MUSN (Militaristic Undead Swamp Naga) and Their Temple\|001_261223_MUSN (Militaristic Undead Swamp Naga) and Their Temple]]
### Appearance
A raised marble platform, open to the sky and surrounded by columns, four large sacrifice bowl (person-sized) and a large bonefire in the middle. These spots are laced with blue stone and had humanoid remains in them.
### Notes
There is an unseen voice that contacts anyone who steps on the platform. When that happens, everything seems to go black. It was quite polite and seemed to expect a sacrifice. It can cast some sort of some mental effect to try and prevent escape, which manifests as a huge blue lighting.
