### First met
When we first arrived at [[Locations/Absalom\|Absalom]]
### Appearance
Two dwarfs
### Notes
They helped [[Groups/Xian Ninja Army\|Xian Ninja Army]] buy properties in [[Locations/Absalom\|Absalom]], so they could invade through tunnels. They escaped [[Locations/Absalom\|Absalom]] before [[Events/Xian - Absalom Conflict\|the attack]]  took place.
