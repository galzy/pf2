### Recap of the last session
TBD
### Summary
- [[Players/Doliat Dreameyes\|Doliat]] researched the items we stole from [[NPCs/Twinkle\|Twinkle]]:  [[Items/Vallmozon's infernal coin\|Vallmozon's infernal coin]] and [[Items/Two sterile scrolls\|Two sterile scrolls]]
- [[Players/Ron Mhuilinn\|Ron]] decided to investigate the source of [[Players/Doliat Dreameyes\|Doliat]]'s power. He couldn't tell anything special about them, expect that he hasn't seen anything overtly evil.
- On the way to the cave where  [[NPCs/Kilgore the Warlock\|Killgore]] is hiding, we fought more [[Groups/MUSN\|MUSN]]s. A few escaped.
- It turned out there are two MUSN camps, with the path to the cave being between them. 
- We detoured around one of them and saw a [[Locations/creepy swamp temple\|creepy temple]] where humanoid sacrifice take place.
- When [[Players/Doliat Dreameyes\|Doliat]] stepped unto the temple platform â€‹he was contacted by an unseen voice. It seemed to expect a sacrifice and when Doliat panicked and ran away, it tried to stop him. A huge blue lighting struck the temple and he had to fight off a mental effect to escape.
- [[Players/Johnra Kcir\|Johnra Kcir]] decided everyone was aware of us anyway, so he lighted the central bonefire.
- We heard dozens of [[Groups/MUSN\|MUSN]]s arriving and we ran for our lives, successfully escaping them.

### Log
- [[Players/Doliat Dreameyes\|Doliat]] researched the items we stole from [[NPCs/Twinkle\|Twinkle]]:
	- An [[Lore/Infernal Coins\|infernal coin]]:
		- Each coin represents a favor owned by a specific demon. Used as a sort of currency.
		- This is [[Items/Vallmozon's infernal coin\|Vallmozon's infernal coin]] who is mid-level+ demon with despair vibes.
	- [[Items/Two sterile scrolls\|Two scrolls]]:
		- Supposedly non-magical and "emotionally sterile".
		- This is very suspicious, as no object is 100% without emotions. Most likely done intentionally, maybe even specifically against [[Players/Doliat Dreameyes\|Doliat]]    
- [[Players/Ron Mhuilinn\|Ron]] decided to investigate the source of [[Players/Doliat Dreameyes\|Doliat]]'s power. He couldn't tell anything special about them, expect that he hasn't seen anything overtly evil. [[Players/Johnra Kcir\|Johnra]] was still suspicious. 
- On the way to the cave where the [[NPCs/Kilgore the Warlock\|Kilgore the Warlock]] is hiding, we fought more [[Groups/MUSN\|MUSN]]s. A few escaped.
- It turned out there are two MUSN camps, with the path to the cave being between them.
- We detoured around one of them and saw a [[Locations/creepy swamp temple\|creepy temple]].
	- [[Players/Doliat Dreameyes\|Doliat]] got a vision:
		- Humanoid sacrifice recently took place.
		- There were around 40 [[Groups/MUSN\|MUSN]]s there, prying in front of the main alter.
		- Four of them wore full body armor
		- There was a robed figure there as well
	- [[Players/Doliat Dreameyes\|Doliat]] stepped unto the temple platform:
		- Everything went dark and he was contacted by an unseen voice.
		- It was quite polite and seemed to expect a sacrifice. When Doliat didn't reply properly, it was surprised.
		- Doliat panicked and ran away. A huge blue lighting struck the temple and he had to fight off some mental effect to escape.
	- [[Players/Johnra Kcir\|Johnra Kcir]] decided everyone was aware of use, so he lighted the centeral bonefire
- We then heard dozens of [[Groups/MUSN\|MUSN]]s arriving and we escaped quickly.
