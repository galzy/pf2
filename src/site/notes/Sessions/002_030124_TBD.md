### Summary
- [[Players/Doliat Dreameyes\|Doliat]] researched the items we stole from [[NPCs/Twinkle\|Twinkle]]:  [[Items/Vallmozon's infernal coin\|Vallmozon's infernal coin]] and [[Items/Two sterile scrolls\|Two sterile scrolls]]
- [[Players/Ron\|Ron]] decided to investigate the source of [[Players/Doliat Dreameyes\|Doliat]]'s power. He couldn't tell anything special about them, expect that he hasn't seen anything overtly evil.
- On the way to the cave where the [[NPCs/serial killer\|serial killer]] is hiding, we fought more [[Groups/MUSN\|MUSN]]s. A few escaped.
- It turned out there are two MUSN camps, with the path to the cave being between them. 
- We detoured around one of them and saw a [[Locations/creepy MUSN temple\|creepy temple]] where humanoid sacrifice take place.
- When [[Players/Doliat Dreameyes\|Doliat]] stepped unto the temple platform â€‹he was contacted by an unseen voice. It seemed to expect a sacrifice and when Doliat panicked and ran away, it tried to stop him. A huge blue lighting struck the temple and he had to fight off a mental effect to escape.
- [[Players/Johnra Kir\|Johnra Kir]] decided everyone was aware of us anyway, so he lighted the sacrificial fires.
- We heard dozens of [[Groups/MUSN\|MUSN]]s arriving and we ran for our lives, successfully escaping them.
