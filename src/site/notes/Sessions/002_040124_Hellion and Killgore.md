### Summary
- [[Players/Doliat Dreameyes\|Doliat]] researched the items we stole from [[NPCs/Twinkle\|Twinkle]]:  [[Items/Vallmozon's infernal coin\|Vallmozon's infernal coin]] and [[Items/Two sterile scrolls\|Two sterile scrolls]]
- [[Players/Ron Mhuilinn\|Ron]] decided to investigate the source of [[Players/Doliat Dreameyes\|Doliat]]'s power. He couldn't tell anything special about them, expect that he hasn't seen anything overtly evil.
- On the way to the cave where the [[NPCs/Kilgore the Warlock\|Kilgore the Warlock]] is hiding, we fought more [[Groups/MUSN\|MUSN]]s. A few escaped.
- It turned out there are two MUSN camps, with the path to the cave being between them. 
- We detoured around one of them and saw a [[Locations/creepy swamp temple\|creepy temple]] where humanoid sacrifice take place.
- When [[Players/Doliat Dreameyes\|Doliat]] stepped unto the temple platform ​he was contacted by an unseen voice. It seemed to expect a sacrifice and when Doliat panicked and ran away, it tried to stop him. A huge blue lighting struck the temple and he had to fight off a mental effect to escape.
- [[Players/Johnra Kcir\|Johnra Kcir]] decided everyone was aware of us anyway, so he lighted the central bonefire.
- We heard dozens of [[Groups/MUSN\|MUSN]]s arriving and we ran for our lives, successfully escaping them.

### Summary

### Log
- We woke up after a full night's rest.
- [[Players/Dio Stargazer\|Dio]]: the [[Locations/creepy swamp temple\|creepy swamp temple]] doesn't seem like the kind of place nagas would use. ​it was made recently by powerful magic. To control these many [[Groups/MUSN\|MUSN]]s, a very powerful necromancer is needed.
- Immediately after leaving for [[Locations/Killgore's cave\|Killgore's cave]], [[Players/Talion\|Talion]] noticed a magical ripple in the air, which a sphere surrounding us. [[Players/Doliat Dreameyes\|Doliat]] felt these were several different spells. [[Players/Dio Stargazer\|Dio]] tried to cast a spell, which failed, due to an anti magic effect. We tried to leave and hit a wall of force 
- [[NPCs/Hellion\|Hellion]], a yellow haired elf in Victorian cloths, looking pale and ill, greeted us. He was accompanied by 57 [[Groups/MUSN\|MUSN]]s.
- He laughed at us, said [[Players/Indigo\|Indigo]] is a halfbreed and was generally racist. He is the one that created the [[Locations/creepy swamp temple\|creepy swamp temple]] and wanted to sacrifice us there. He was a fan of [[NPCs/Kilgore the Warlock\|Killgore]] and was looking for him, saying they served the same master. He called [[NPCs/Zima\|Zima]] who was studying nagas now.
- After almost getting attacked by all the [[Groups/MUSN\|MUSN]]s, We surrendered our weapons. [[NPCs/Hellion\|Hellion]] knew of [[Players/Indigo\|Indigo]] and his history and got excited about capturing him. He  went to talk to his master. We were escorted to a cage near the temple, which was being repaired.
- [[Players/Doliat Dreameyes\|Doliat]] charmed [[NPCs/Zima\|Zima]] and asked him to blow the horn of blasting at another part of the camp, to create a distraction for our escape. One of the guards got suspicious, so he had to blow it early. Most of the [[Groups/MUSN\|MUSN]]s and [[Players/Ron Mhuilinn\|Ron]] failed their throws and were damaged and deafened. The horn exploded and killed [[NPCs/Zima\|Zima]]. [[Players/Talion\|Talion]] picked the lock and [[Players/Dio Stargazer\|Dio]] cast invisibility sphere on us. We got our weapons back and escaped undetected. We kept on going to [[Locations/Killgore's cave\|Killgore's cave]].
- [[Players/Doliat Dreameyes\|Doliat]] got a feeling we should go at a slightly different direction. We got to the cave we saw in the scrying and stopped to rest and meditate.
- When we entered, we saw tracks of a single humanoid and some items: A newspaper piece about [[Players/Indigo\|Indigo]]'s father murder, old cutlery, a [[Items/Medallion of confusion\|medallion]] (thin metal chain with a many faceted gem, the size of an an acorn, with odd patterns). [[Players/Doliat Dreameyes\|Doliat]] felt emotions of confusion from it. He put it on and felt very confused. He also forgot why he was there and who were the others. He tried to dispel the effect with his [[Items/Ring of Antimagic\|antimagic ring]] and managed to do it, beating a will DC of probably 40. 
- There were cultivated edible mushrooms that have been harvested both recently and years ago. We met an old frail elf wearing tattered cloths and covered in "junky sores". He had the air of an upper class upbringing.
- We cuffed him and asked for his identity. He said his name was Zeligar, but [[Players/Johnra Kcir\|Johnra]] recognized it was actually [[NPCs/Kilgore the Warlock\|Killgore]]. He claimed to have no knowledge about [[NPCs/Kilgore the Warlock\|Killgore]] asked for his chain or [[Players/Indigo\|Indigo]] and got very agitated when he discovered we had his chain. We let him put it on, and he calmed down.
- We kept going down the cave and came upon cavern with a stream in the middle. [[NPCs/Kilgore the Warlock\|Killgore]] said it led to an [[Lore/Entrances to the Underdark\|entrance to the underdark]] and that a few hours' walk from there was a [[Locations/Unnamed Drow city near Kyonin\|Drow city]], with whom he had traded in the past. There were tracks of a large many-legged creature, as well as ordered tunnels to the underdark.
-  We had a full night's rest.
-  [[Players/Doliat Dreameyes\|Doliat]] felt even better after the first night, but was still recovering. He tried to dispel [[NPCs/Kilgore the Warlock\|Killgore]]'s amnesia but failed.
- We had a full night's rest.
- [[Players/Doliat Dreameyes\|Doliat]] felt much better, but was still recovering. He tried to dispel [[NPCs/Kilgore the Warlock\|Killgore]]'s amnesia but failed. We decided to take the [[Items/Medallion of confusion\|medallion]] off him, so could remember on his own. He became distressed and showed withdrawal-like symptoms, so we gave him some of [[Players/Indigo\|Indigo]]'s purple sleeping powder.
- We had a full night's rest.
- [[NPCs/Kilgore the Warlock\|Killgore]] started remembering things and his demeanor changed. The DC got lower after he recovered a bit and  [[Players/Doliat Dreameyes\|Doliat]] managed to dispel magic with his [[Items/Ring of Antimagic\|ring]] and the amnesia was lifted.
- We started interrogating him:
	- He wanted  the chain back, so he can forget again his dealings with his [[Groups/Demon family\|demon patrons]].
	- He said that the murder of Indigo's father was one of his finest works.
	- We asked how we can reach  [[NPCs/Shissela\|Indigo's mom]] and he said he didn't know how. They came to him, not the other way around. Furthermore, trying to reach he will only serve the [[Groups/Demon family\|demon patrons]]. They wanted her back, because she ran away from home.
	- He tried to use some sort of mental spell on us, so we roughed him up a bit.
	- We wanted to be sure he wasn't holding back. [[Players/Doliat Dreameyes\|Doliat]]  charmed him, but it quickly wore off because [[Players/Johnra Kcir\|Johnra]] poisoned him. He did confirm he was telling the truth.
	-  [[Players/Dio Stargazer\|Dio]], [[Players/Indigo\|Indigo]] and especially [[Players/Johnra Kcir\|Johnra]] brutally tortured him, supposedly to make sure he wasn't holding back. He kept saying he was willingly cooperating.
	- [[Players/Doliat Dreameyes\|Doliat]] asked him if we can use a stolen infernal coin to claim a favor and he said it isn't, ad they are just a metaphor. He then left the area in protest of the torture.
- [[Players/Indigo\|Indigo]] claimed his vengeance and killed [[NPCs/Kilgore the Warlock\|Killgore]] by slitting his throat. On the corpse we found a [[Items/Killgore's key\|small golden key]] and a small bag containing [[Items/Killgore's two magical rings\|two rings]], both of which were magical.
