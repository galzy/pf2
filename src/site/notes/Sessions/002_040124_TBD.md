### Summary
- [[Players/Doliat Dreameyes\|Doliat]] researched the items we stole from [[NPCs/Twinkle\|Twinkle]]:  [[Items/Vallmozon's infernal coin\|Vallmozon's infernal coin]] and [[Items/Two sterile scrolls\|Two sterile scrolls]]
- [[Players/Ron Mhuilinn\|Ron]] decided to investigate the source of [[Players/Doliat Dreameyes\|Doliat]]'s power. He couldn't tell anything special about them, expect that he hasn't seen anything overtly evil.
- On the way to the cave where the [[NPCs/Kilgore the Warlock\|Kilgore the Warlock]] is hiding, we fought more [[Groups/MUSN\|MUSN]]s. A few escaped.
- It turned out there are two MUSN camps, with the path to the cave being between them. 
- We detoured around one of them and saw a [[Locations/creepy swamp temple\|creepy temple]] where humanoid sacrifice take place.
- When [[Players/Doliat Dreameyes\|Doliat]] stepped unto the temple platform â€‹he was contacted by an unseen voice. It seemed to expect a sacrifice and when Doliat panicked and ran away, it tried to stop him. A huge blue lighting struck the temple and he had to fight off a mental effect to escape.
- [[Players/Johnra Kcir\|Johnra Kcir]] decided everyone was aware of us anyway, so he lighted the central bonefire.
- We heard dozens of [[Groups/MUSN\|MUSN]]s arriving and we ran for our lives, successfully escaping them.

#### Summary
Bla
#### Log
- [[Players/Dio Stargazer\|Dio Stargazer]]:
	- the [[Locations/creepy swamp temple\|creepy swamp temple]] isn't the type of place that is usually related to the [[Groups/MUSN\|MUSN]]s.
	- it was recently made by powerful magic.
	- to control these many [[Groups/MUSN\|MUSN]], a very powerful necromancer is needed.
- We left for the cave. Talion noticed a magical ripple in the air and noticed it's a large sphere sourounding us. Doliat felt these were several different spells. Dio tried to cast a spell, which failed. We tried to leave and hit a wall of force 
- we saw a yellow haired elf in voctorian cloths, looking pale and il. He was accompanied by 57 [[Groups/MUSN\|MUSN]]s. He laughd at us and said Dio is a halfbreed and was generally racist. He made the temple and wanted to secrefise us. He is looking for Kilgore and  is called Hellion. He "worships" Kilgore and said they have the same master.  He called Zima who is studying nagas.
-  we surendered our weapons. Helion knew of Indigo and his history. He got excited and went to talk to his master. We were escorted to a cage near the temple being ripiared.
- Doliat charmed Zima and asked him to blow the horn of blasting at another part of the camp. One of the gurd was suspicious, so he had to blow it early. Most the naga failed, and on our side only Ron. The horn exploded and killed him.
- Talion picked the lock and [[Players/Dio Stargazer\|Dio Stargazer]] cast invisibility sphere. We got our weapons and escaped undetected. We kept going to Kilgore
- Doliat got a feeling we should go at a slightly different direction. We got to the cave we saw in the scrying. We stopped to rest and meditate for 30 minutes.
- we saw tracks of a single humanoid and some items: A newspaper piece about indigos father murder piece, old cutlery, a medlion (thin metal chain with a many faceted gem, the size of an acron, with odd peatterens). Doliat felt emotions of confusion from it. Dollat put it on and felt very confused. He also forgot why he was there and who were the others.
- There were cultivated ediable mushrooms that were recently. We me an old frail elf wearing tattered cloths. He is covered in junky sores. He has upper class upbringing . We cuffed him. He said his name was Zeligar. Jhonra recognized it was actually Kilgore. He asks for his chain and we put it on him. He calmed down.
- we kept going down the cave and came upon cavran with a stream in the middle. He said it led to the underdark. There were tracks of a large many-legged creature, as well as ordered tunnels to the underark.
- We rested for two nights, while trying to dispal Kilgore's amnesia. He was without the chain and he started slowly remembering. Doliat's dispal magic from his ring worked on the third day and remembered much more.
	- He said that the murder of indigo's father was one of his finest work. He said getting to her would only help the demon patrons. He said they are her brothers. he didn't know to get to her, they came to him  The patrons wanted her back, because she ran from home.
	- he wanted the chain back 
	- indigo killed him. On the corpse we a small golden key and a small sack with two rings. Both are magical.
